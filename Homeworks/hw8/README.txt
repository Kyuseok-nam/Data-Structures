COLLABORATORS AND OTHER RESOURCES:
List the names of everyone you talked to about this assignment
(classmates, TAs, ALAC tutors, upperclassmen, students/instructor via
LMS, etc.), and all of the resources (books, online reference
material, etc.) you consulted in completing this assignment.

< none / lecture notes >

Remember: Your implementation for this assignment must be done on your
own, as described in "Academic Integrity for Homework" handout.


ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  < insert 25 hours >


TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

I used gdb debugger to check out the values inside the variables to fix bugs and errors


MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  

When the nodes split and then a new key value is inserted into the parent node. The vector.push_Back for keys keep returning a different value after it gets pushed backed in. I'm not sure why this is 
Happening. I tried to figure it out and struggled on it for 6 hours waiting for a office hour. But 
The queue was too long and I wasn't able to get any help. I believe that the rest of the code is 
Working fine besides that. I put in a lot of std::cout to check what's going on to while trying debug
That vector pushback error. I'm Hoping I could get some feed back on why that is happening. 
Thank you!
